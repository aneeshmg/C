JumpSearch
===============================

* This algorithm has a constant time complexity if the data is evenly distributed in the array
* This algorithm will obtain the search result in 2 or less iterations if the data is evenly distributed
* For the data to be "evenly distributed", the difference between the array elements must be close to the value (array[N] / N) where N is the number of elements in the array
